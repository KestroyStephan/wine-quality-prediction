# üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction App

An interactive **Machine Learning Web Application** that predicts whether a wine is **Good** or **Bad** based on its chemical properties.  
Built with **Streamlit**, trained using the **Wine Quality Dataset**, and deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**.


## üìå Project Overview
This project demonstrates the complete **Machine Learning Deployment Pipeline**:
1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**  
2. **Model Training & Evaluation** (Random Forest, Logistic Regression)  
3. **Model Selection & Saving** with `joblib`  
4. **Interactive Web App Development** using Streamlit  
5. **Deployment to the Cloud** for public access  

The model classifies wines into:
- **Good (1)** ‚Üí High-quality wine
- **Bad (0)** ‚Üí Low-quality wine

## üìÇ Dataset
- **Name:** Wine Quality Dataset (`WineQT.csv`)  
- **Source:** [Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset/data)  
- **Description:** Contains physicochemical properties (acidity, sugar, pH, etc.) and quality ratings for red wine samples.  

**Features include:**
- Fixed acidity  
- Volatile acidity  
- Citric acid  
- Residual sugar  
- Chlorides  
- Free sulfur dioxide  
- Total sulfur dioxide  
- Density  
- pH  
- Sulphates  
- Alcohol  

**Target variable:**
- `quality` ‚Üí converted into binary `good` (1) and `bad` (0) for classification.
